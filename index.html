					Make: I make things. I have eight years of experience designing, prototyping, fabricating, testing, repairing and modifying audio electronics, but I also work with general purpose devices, occasionally blacksmith, make jewelry, do woodworking, make letterpress prints and code. I'm interested in developping personal relationships with the objects of everyday life to get the most of them and myself. </p>
					
				<p>	I also make sounds, which sometimes become music. I've been in a band since I was thirteen years old (bass), and have since moved on to guitar, synthesizers and electronics, which I occasionaly use for installations. I'm interested in the materiality of modern composition, and more specifically, how opening up musical devices can inform a musical practice. </p>
					
				<p>	I view composition and fabrication as two aspects of the same process. </p>
					
				<p>	Document: I've been researching the makers of electronic music ("Silicon Luthiers," thank you Nic Collins) for the past years, digging through online forums and old library archives, and interviewing a wide variety of practitioners. This has both physical consequences (the design of a novel high fidelity vacuum tube audio amplifier for my undergraduate thesis), creative consequences (much of my music is inspired by my in-depth technical inquiries) and scholarly consequences (my master's thesis offers a contextualization of modern making practices in electronic music and shows how to include component level analysis in musicological discussions).</p>
					
				<p>	Share: I have taught as a T.A. and occasionally professor at the summer camp, primary and secondary education level since I was eighteen, and particularly enjoy sharing the few things I know with anyone who is interested. I'm interested in creating welcoming, accessible spaces for education, within and outside existing institutions.</p> 
					
				<p>	All my music, designs, publications and code are available for free unless my arm was twisted. You should feel free to request more information or documentation on any project mentioned here, and I'll do my best to provide as fully as possible.</p>
