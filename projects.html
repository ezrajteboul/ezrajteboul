			<h5> Gameduino Chaotic Oscillator (audio+video synthesizer)
				</h5>
			<p>status: R&D</p>
			<p>This is a project to combine a v.1 Gameduino shield (with VGA and 12 bit Audio out), a regular Arduino Uno and the code provided from <a href="http://jlswbs.blogspot.com/">a now defunct blog</a> to generate audio-visual chaos (in the form of chaotic noise/signal generators and attractors). 
				
				Here is a copy of the code for a Sprott-Linz P Chaotic Attractor: 
				

				<p>#include "SPI.h"
				#include "GD.h"

				       byte i;
				       float a = 2.7;
				       float x = 0.1;
				       float y = 0;
				       float z = 0;
				       float xn = x;
				       float yn = y;
				       float zn = z;
				       float dt = 0.01; 
       
				void setup()
				{
				       GD.begin();
				       GD.ascii();
				       GD.wr16(RAM_SPRPAL + (0 * 2), 0x8000);
				       GD.wr16(RAM_SPRPAL + (1 * 2), RGB(255, 255, 255));
				       GD.fill(RAM_SPRIMG, 0, 256);
				       GD.wr(RAM_SPRIMG + 0x78, 1);
				       GD.putstr(10, 1, "Sprott-Linz P chaotic attractor");
				}

				void loop()
				{
				       xn = a*y+z;
				       yn = -x+pow(y,2);
				       zn = x+y;
				       x = x+xn*dt;
				       y = y+yn*dt;
				       z = z+zn*dt;
				       GD.sprite(i++, 100+(140*x), 190+(132*y), 0, 0, 0);
				}
			</p>
			
			<p>I'm currently working on getting a better understanding of JLS's code and working to archive all the attractor's they've shared online in case the cached pages disappear</p>
			
			<h5> Eurorack format Pure Data module (with Touchscreen?)
				</h5>
				
			<p>status: R&D</p>
			<p>
				This is a project to combine a Beaglebone black running Pure Data in Ubuntu and take advantage of the i/o natively available onboard. I'm currently working on getting pure data to function fully.

			<h5> Acht Br√ºcken project: "singer" (a collaborative project with COLLCTV)
				</h5>
			<p>
	status: completed, de-installed 			
				</p>
				
				<p> This project was a two-week installation piece designed for the courtyard of the Sankt-Peter Kunst Station / church space in Koln, Germany. It was a collaboration between Shannon Werle, Angela Kim, Carlos Dominguez and myself. I was in charge of designing the motor system and contributed to fabrication efforts. The installation won second place for art installations in the festival. </p>
